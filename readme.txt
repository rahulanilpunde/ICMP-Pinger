NOTE: 
1)Make sure you have set the admin rights by setting the parameters accordingly in the property settings of python's IDLE GUI.

2) I haven't included website poly.edu mentioned in the PDF since its server does not reply to the ICMP packets resulting in a constant request time out.

 
Development Environment:

1) Python 2.7.8 (64-bit)
2) Windows 7
